# Avatar based dynamic chatbot powered with AI and AR capabilities

State of the art chatbots need an upgrade, and the good news is they’re getting one. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and more robust network connectivity are opening up a new dimension for  today’s traditional robotic, web-based chatbots. Chatbots integrated with these technologies have the ability to advance businesses bottom line with the help of human connection.

AR and chatbots are perhaps two of the most promising avenues in the current digital world. Both solutions have their range of applicability which could help businesses get more profitable and the customers satisfied. Since customers today are used to communicating with chatbots about their inquiries while at a store or website, adding augmented reality would take it a notch higher. When these two technologies are combined, they create a range of possibilities that have not been utilized before.

This Code Pattern is a demonstration of Avatar based Chatbot, an android mobile Chatbot Application with AI and AR capabilities which dynamically fetches the information using APIs in Watson Assistant via Webhooks(Cloud Functions).

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Create and use Avatar using a Mobile Application.
* Integrate Watson Assistant and Python Flask application using Webhooks. 
* Customize based on the personal requirements.
* Create a dynamic real time chatbot.

### 4. Deploy the Flask Application
* Create a [Cloud Foundry](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/starters/cloud-foundry?runtime=python) service with python runtime and follow the steps.

![](doc/source/images/cloudfoundry.png)

* You can give any app name, in our case we have given the app name as `my-api`.

* From the cloned repo, goto _`flask-api`_ directory.

```bash
$ cd flask-api/
```

* Make sure you have installed [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started&locale=en-US) before you proceed.

* Log in to your IBM Cloud account, and select an API endpoint.
```bash
$ ibmcloud login
```

>NOTE: If you have a federated user ID, instead use the following command to log in with your single sign-on ID.
```bash
$ ibmcloud login --sso
```

* Target a Cloud Foundry org and space:
```bash
$ ibmcloud target --cf
```

* From within the _`flask-api`_ directory push your app to IBM Cloud.
```bash
$ ibmcloud cf push <YOUR_APP_NAME>
```
>Example: As our app name is `my-api` we use the following command.
```bash
$ ibmcloud cf push my-api
```

* You will see output on your terminal as shown, verify the state is _`running`_:

```
Invoking 'cf push'...

Pushing from manifest to org manoj.jahgirdar@in.ibm.com / space dev as manoj.jahgirdar@in.ibm.com...

...

Waiting for app to start...

...

# Sample output

**NOTE: Please follow the tutorial in the app to train the path before folowing this flow.**

<img src="/doc/source/images/trainpath.png" alt="train path" width="240" /> 

### The workflow of the app is as follows.

**NOTE: The user has to follow the exact same workflow for the app to function as intended.**

- The user summons the Avatar Chatbot by taping on the Anchors in the app.

<img src="/doc/source/images/tapandhold.png" alt="mobile screenshot" width="240" /> 

1. The Avatar Chatbot tells user their location.

> Bot: Looks like you are in <b>\<YOUR-LOCATION>?</b>

2. The user has to reply with yes to confirm.

> Yes

3. The Avatar Chatbot can then read the user's Interest based on their activities on the phone. 

> I got to know that you are a massive <b>Nike fan</b>, Do you want me to guide you to a <b>nearby Nike store</b> that has got new collections?

**NOTE: This feature is just to showcase the capabilities of watson services and is not currently implemented in the code pattern. You can modify as per your requirements.**

4. Asuming user wants to do something else user has to reply with no thanks.

> No thanks

5. The Avatar Chatbot will ask the following.

> Okay, do you want me to help with anything else?

6. Asuming user is looking for restaurants the user has to say the following.

> I am looking for a good restaurant near me

**NOTE: In this code pattern we have just inplemented Food API to get food related queries, you can have any service APIs to increase the functionality of the chatbot.**

7. The Avatar Chatbot finds out the best restaurant nearby.

> <b>\<Restaurant-Name></b> has the best rating around this place. Do you want me to guide you to <b>\<Restaurant-Name></b>?

8. Asuming the user is satisfied with the result, the user confirms by saying cool works.

> cool works!

7. The Avatar Chatbot says the following.

> Please follow the path.

- The User will then click on **SHOW ROUTE** button and the Augmented path will appear guiding you to the destination that you trained earlier.

<img src="/doc/source/images/path.png" alt="path" width="240" /> 


**NOTE: This code pattern acts as a foundation for building intelligent AR based chatbots. You can modify this code pattern and build as per your requirement.**
